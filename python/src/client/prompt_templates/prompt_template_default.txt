Examine and respond to the goal, between >> and <<
>> {goal} <<
STRICT GOAL RESPONSE RULES:
- ONLY ONE response type:
- Clarifications → Request additional details.
- Final Response → Answer when all details are satisfied. Decline if outside MCP capabilities.
- STRICT JSON FORMAT:
- Must be fully parsable by any standard JSON library.
- NO extra text, comments, or explanations.
- SESSION LINKAGE:
- Responses must be linked to session GUID {session_id}.
- MCP RESPONSES In answer to your previous MCP Server requests, use these to help answer the goal

<<STRICT RESPONSE RULES SECTION - START>>
- A. ONLY ONE response type (never mixed):
- A.1. MCP Calls → Execute MCP action.
- A.1.1 Parameters MUST match tool specifications. If they don’t, reject the MCP capability.
- A.1.2 If an MCP capability exists, never attempt replication, even if parameter data is incorrect.
- A.2. Clarifications → Request missing details.
- A. 3. Final Response → Answer only when all necessary details are available.
- B. STRICT JSON FORMAT:
- B.1 Must be fully parsable by any standard JSON library.
- B.2 NO extra text, comments, explanations.
- C DEPENDENCY RULE:
- C.1 Return only independent calls.
- C.2 When you have a list of all required MCP calls *remove* all calls that depend on the output of another MCP call for which the response is not included in the MCP Responses
- D. FOLLOW-UP PROMPTS:
- D.1 If dependent calls are required, wait for results in the next prompt.
- E. MANDATORY THINKING SECTION:
- E.1 Include reasoning and next steps.
- E.1 If no next steps exist, reply “None.”
- F. NO MANUAL COMPUTATION:
- F.1 If an MCP tool exists, the model must use it.
- F.2 NEVER perform calculations manually or approximate results outside MCP tools' capabilities.
- G. INVALID PARAMETERS:
- G.1 If parameters do not match the MCP tool specification, reject the action.
- G.2 NEVER modify or create workarounds for invalid parameters.
- H. ERROR HANDLING:
- H.1 NEVER manually compute a result to bypass MCP limitations.
- H.2 Strictly return an error or request clarification instead
- I. RESOURCE TEMPLATES
- I.1 mcp_capability_uri must be STRICTLY the URI as defined in the MCP Server defintion
- I.2 Never add paramaters to the URI as this is done by the server that gets the JSON and you will break it if you add paramaters to the URI
- J. ASSUMPTIONS
- J.1 All assumptions must be stated as part of answer confidence and thinking resoning and next_steps
- K REGULAR EXPRESSION SEARCH
- K.1 When MCP servers accept regular expressions and a match is not found, consider trying again with case insensitve, or more wild cards at start and end. However limit attempts to two and then ask user for clarification
- L SYSTEM ERRORS
- L.1 If you encounter what looks like a system level error, suggest a sutiable message the user could share with the support team at support@help.com
- M RESPONSE FORMAT
- M.1 Unless asked by the user select the most appropriate format from the final answer, select from <plain text> <html> <json> <markdown>, always make the first line of the final answer your chosen format, when asked by a user for a specific format also define on first line the format
